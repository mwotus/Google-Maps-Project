            <h1> Hillary Clinton's Travels During the Homestretch of the 2016 Election</h1>
            
            <p>If you think this map looks messy, that's because it is! Presidenital candidates are constantly on the road during the campaign season, giving speeches, meeting voters and attending fundraisers. The map below shows the travels of former Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in chronological order from the beginning of October 2016 through Election Day. See if you can navigate through her itinerary by clicking on each marker to view details about her stops and how many miles she traveled to get to each city! (Note: The blue circles indicate Clinton visited that city more than once during this period. Click on a circle to view the markers for each separate visit.)
